# Ex2: Write a NumPy program to test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array
Input Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60]
      Array2: [10, 30, 40]
Output: [False  True False  True False]

# Ex3: Write a NumPy program to find the indices of the maximum and minimum values along the given axis of an array
Input: [1,6,4,8,9,-4,-2,11]
Output: 
Max = 11
Min = -4
